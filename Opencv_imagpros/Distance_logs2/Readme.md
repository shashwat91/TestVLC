# Logs Description

Images for Manchester encoding with preamble as "10001", and taken at different distances and different frequencies.
Folder represents frequency of interrupt(on-off freq.).

## Different Matrices:
### Frequencies (Hz):
500, 600, 700, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000.
### Distances from light (cm):
30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300.

## On-Off timing(freq) combinations for different frequencies
